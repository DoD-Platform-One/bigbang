# Product Team

Responsible for building the COMMON Big Bang product.

## Product Team Sprint Planning

### Normal Rhythm

* Two week sprints starting on a Tuesday
* Continue to improve planning every week
* All team members who have capacity to work on the PRODUCT backlog should attend the planning session

### Work Breakdown

* The Big Bang PRODUCT work will be continuously updated within GitLab by the Big Bang Product Manager, Anchors, and Anchor Shanks
* The pre-planning activity will execute the following planning steps:

1. Review current team objectives
1. (Re-)prioritize work at the Epic level
1. Assess ( ballpark ) amount of the work the team can accomplish within the next week

* The planning activity will execute the following planning steps per planning "team":

1. Review/update the currently OPEN and prioritized Epics provided by the pre-planning activity
1. Decompose the Epic work into stories by writing new or updating existing stories in Jira to accomplish the Epic objectives
1. Identify and capture any intra-story dependencies in Jira
1. Prioritize the stories to be accomplished
1. Add stories to the sprint backlog roughly equivalent to the team's capacity

### Sprint Execution

* Daily PRODUCT team standup -
Should discuss EPIC level issues ( dependencies, issues,etc) and be less than 15 minutes
* Daily EPIC team scrums - team members brief based on Jira Story or Task

1. Review accomplishments in the last 24 hours
1. Planned work in the next 24 hours
1. Any blockers or helps required
1. Individual Stories will be accepted
1. Sprint retro ( bi-weekly to start on Thursday to inform Tues planning)
1. Sprint DEMO - working software
1. [FUTURE] Team capacity planning

### Core Concepts

* Succeed or fail as a team
* Work pairing is highly encouraged
* Collaboration/Communication will be key to team success
* Look for ways to improve the PRODUCT and the process
