# Documentation Locations

> This charter doc represents the future state we are working toward

## BigBang Docs:

### Where is the best place to look for documentation on BigBang? 

- https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/bigbang/-/tree/master/docs/
- Our goal is to have near 100% of publicly sharable docs in this centralized location to act as a single source of truth where all documentation can be found and help move docs out of IL2 Confluence and Private Repos to better support the open source community. 

### What types of documentation can be found in the docs folder? 

- Developer Contribution Docs
- Docs to help understand BigBang (At a concrete level, what the value add is, and Architecture Diagrams)
- Deployment Prerequisites
- Deployment Docs for Internet Connected and Disconnected deployments


## BigBang Package Docs:

### Where is the best place to look for documentation on BigBang Packages? 

- Our goal is to have these docs available on a webpage hosted on the BigBang Cluster using Hugo       
  (https://docs.bigbang.dev by default) (look [here](./PackageDocumentation.md) for more info)
- This allows us to support a centralized location for package configuration documentation, while allowing support for dynamically added versions of distributed packages in a maintainable way.
