          System-level access controls
          Keycloak supports fine-grained authorization policies and is able to combine different access control mechanisms such as:

            - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
            - Role-based access control (RBAC)
            - User-based access control (UBAC)
            - Context-based access control (CBAC)
            - Rule-based access control
            - Using JavaScript
            - Time-based access control
            - Support for custom access control mechanisms (ACMs) through a Policy Provider Service Provider Interface (SPI)

          Keycloak is based on a set of administrative UIs and a RESTful API, and provides the necessary means to create permissions for your protected resources and scopes, associate those permissions with authorization policies, and enforce authorization decisions in your applications and services.
          Resource servers (applications or services serving protected resources) usually rely on some kind of information to decide if access should be granted to a protected resource. For RESTful-based resource servers, that information is usually obtained from a security token, usually sent as a bearer token on every request to the server. For web applications that rely on a session to authenticate users, that information is usually stored in a user’s session and retrieved from there for each request.
          Permissions can be created to protect two main types of objects:

            - Resources: resource-based permission defines a set of one or more resources to protect using a set of one or more authorization policies.
            - Scopes: scope-based permissions defines a set of one or more scopes to protect using a set of one or more authorization policies. Unlike resource-based permissions, you can use this permission type to create permissions not only for a resource, but also for the scopes associated with it, providing more granularity when defining the permissions that govern your resources and the actions that can be performed on them.

            https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/

          Organizational access controls
          Organizational roles could be broken down into cluster admins, resource owners / administrators, clients / users

          Big Bang implements a custom plugin to handle account managment, found here (https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/security-tools/keycloak/-/tree/main/development).  Through this plugin logic is implemented to control automated registration and ties into DoD PKI validation/verification. Additionally, this plugin validates group membership in conjunction with Keycloak Clients to prohibit/allow access to various resources behind the single sign on solution.

            a/c. non-privileged users are prohibited by the keycloak plugin and declarative group structure defined here (https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/security-tools/keycloak/-/tree/main/development). Privileged users follow a similar posture combined with other solutions to prohibit access to resources based on group membership.
            b. Keycloak can be configured for fine grain permissions to assign account managers, additionally the custom plugin allows configuration of groups with specific permissions within the keycloak web UI console.
            d (1-3). Declarative groups specify authorized users, groups, and roles. Access authorizations and assignment is related to Day 2 operations of keycloak and may vary between organizations.
            e. Handled by Day 2 operations of keycloak.
            f. declarative groups assist in the handling of accounts, but ultimate is is a day 2 operation.
            g. Keycloak web UI has a queryable audit logging feature and backend logs can be monitored.
            h. Handled by Day 2 operations of keycloak.
            i. Handled by Day 2 operations of keycloak.
            j. Mostly, handled by Day 2 operations of keycloak. However, built in registration flow validates and verifies DoD level authorization.
            k.  Handled by Day 2 operations of keycloak.
            l.  Handled by Day 2 operations of keycloak.
