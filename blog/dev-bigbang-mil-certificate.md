# Big Bang Mil Domain & Certificate

In late March 2024, Big Bang migrated to a Platform One (P1) owned and operated domain `bigbang.mil` and updated the DEVELOPMENT ONLY certificate we ship with BigBang which makes the process of doing dev setup and quickstart items easier via using a valid and pre-configured certificate. 

This `*.dev.bigbang.mil` certificate is for our team's internal Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines and Development ONLY. No artifacts, articles, pages or downloads will be available behind this domain. If there is anything pointing to or referencing this domain that is publicly available it is NOT owned or operated by P1. Our method of publishing and hosting releases only on `repo1.dso.mil`, `registry1.dso.mil` and `github.com/DoD-Platform-One` will continue to be our method where you can find our artifacts and releases.
