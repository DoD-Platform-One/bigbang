If not supplied the default command will be used: "fluentd -c /fluentd/etc/fluent.conf -v" Note: The custom command can be free-form, however pay particular attention to the process that should ultimately be left running in the container. This process should be invoked with 'exec' so that signals are appropriately propagated to it, for instance SIGTERM. An example of how such a command may look is: "<command 1> && <command 2> && exec <primary command>" |
| fluentd.customConfigFile | bool | `false` | Set to 'true' if a custom config (see 'configmap-fluentd.yaml' for default) should be used for Fluentd. If enabled this config must be supplied via the 'fluentdCustomConfig' property below. |

| serviceAccount.clusterRoleBinding.name | string | `nil` | The name of the ClusterRoleBinding to be created. If not specified, but the "serviceAccount.clusterRoleBinding.create" flag is set to 'true', then the ClusterRoleBinding name will be auto-generated. |

| synchrony.ingressUrl | string | `nil` | The base URL of the Synchrony service. This will be the URL that users' browsers will be given to communicate with Synchrony, as well as the URL that the Confluence service will use to communicate directly with Synchrony, so the URL must be resolvable both from inside and outside the Kubernetes cluster. |

Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed approach. When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the local-home volume(s). If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static |

| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.command | string | `nil` | By default, the fixer will change the group ownership of the volume's root directory to match the Confluence container's GID (2002), and then ensures the directory is group-writeable. If this is not the desired behaviour, command used can be specified here. |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.enabled | bool | `true` | If 'true', this will alter the shared-home volume's root directory so that Confluence can write to it. This is a workaround for a K8s bug affecting NFS volumes: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260 |

| volumes.synchronyHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of synchrony-home using K8s PVs and PVCs NOTE: Due to the ephemeral nature of pods this approach to provisioning volumes for pods is not recommended. Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed approach. When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the synchrony-home volume(s). If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised.
