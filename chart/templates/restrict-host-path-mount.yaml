      hostPath volumes consume the underlying node's file system. If hostPath volumes
      are not universally disabled, they should be restricted to specific
      host paths to prevent access to sensitive information. This policy ensures
      that hostPath volume paths are in the allowed list. It is strongly
      recommended to pair this policy with another to require readOnly on hostPath volumes.
