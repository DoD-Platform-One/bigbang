      Images from unknown, public registries can be of dubious quality and may not be
      scanned and secured, representing a high degree of risk. Requiring use of known, approved
      registries helps reduce threat exposure by ensuring image pulls only come from them. This
      policy validates that all images originate from a registry in the approved list.
