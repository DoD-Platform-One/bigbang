    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Pods which have limits equal to requests are given a Guaranteed quality of service class
      which is the highest schedulable class. The Kubernetes scheduler assigns Guaranteed pods
      only to nodes which have enough resources to fulfil their CPU and memory requests.  In addition,
      Guaranteed pods are the last to be evicted when a node is running low on resources.  This policy
      checks that all containers have memory requests equal to limits to get a Guaranteed QoS class.
      This policy should only be assigned to critical resources.
