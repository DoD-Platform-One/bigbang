# 1. Public ADR Effort

Date: 2025-03-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

ADRs have been used to document architectural decisions in the Big Bang project. The ADRs have been created only privately, restricting the ability for the community to contribute to the decision-making process. The Big Bang team has been working on standardizing the ADR process to make it more transparent and open to the community.

## Decision

Create an adr directory at https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/bigbang/-/tree/master/docs/adrs and copy this ADR to that directory. The ADRs in this directory will be public and open to the community to view and contribute to.

To determine which ADRs should be public, the Big Bang team will use the following criteria:
- ADRs that are related to the architecture of the Big Bang project
- ADRs that are related to technical processes that are used in the Big Bang project

The Big Bang team will not make the following ADRs public:
- ADRs that are related to the internal processes of the Big Bang team
- ADRs that contain sensitive information

## Consequences

If the team doesn't adopt this, there will not be any public ADRs for the community to view and contribute to. This will limit the ability for the community to understand the architectural decisions that are being made in the Big Bang project.

If the team adopts this, the community will be able to view and contribute to the ADRs that are related to the architecture of the Big Bang project.
