# Documentation

Big Bang requires some additional documentation for supported packages to help users understand how it interacts with other components. The following are documents that should be created or updated for integration into Big Bang:

- Package Architecture: Refer to [Big Bang's Architecture instructions](../../../packages/ref-package.md). Examples are included in [the package architecture](../../../packages/categorization.md).
- [Big Bang Packages](../../../packages/index.md)
- [Default Credentials](../../../configuration/default-credentials.md)
- [Licensing](../../../concepts/licensing.md)
- [Minimum Hardware Requirements](../../../getting-started/prerequisites.md#minimum-hardware-requirements)
