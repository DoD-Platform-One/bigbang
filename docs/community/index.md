# Community

Big Bang is an open source project and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're interested in reporting issues, suggesting new features, or contributing code, there are many ways to get involved. See the [Development](development/index.md) section for more information on how to contribute, and check out our [ADRs](adrs/index.md) to understand the architectural decisions behind Big Bang.
