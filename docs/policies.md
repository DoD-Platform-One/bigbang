|Name|Type|Scope|Category|Background|Description|CIS 1.6 Ref|Notes|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|clone-configs|Generate|ConfigMap; Secret|Helper|Configuration held in ConfigMaps or Secrets, like registry credentials, often need to exist in multiple Namespaces so Pods there have access.  Manually duplicating these is time consuming and error prone.|Copies ConfigMaps or Secrets to new Namespaces when they are created.  Will also push updates should the source be changed.|||
|disallow-annotations|Validate|Pod|Best Practices|Some annotations control functionality driven by other cluster-wide tools and are not normally set by some class of users.|Prevents the use of annotations contained in the specified list.||Ensures users either don't set reserved annotations or use a newer version of annotations.|
|disallow-deprecated-apis|Validate|Various|Best Practices|Kubernetes APIs are sometimes deprecated and removed after a few releases.  As a best practice, older API versions should be replaced with newer versions.|Validates API are not deprecated.||Should be run as `audit`|
|disallow-host-namespaces|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|Host namespaces (Process ID, Inter-Process Communication, and network) allow access to shared information and can be used to elevate privileges. Pods should not be allowed access to host namespaces.| Ensures fields (`hostPID`, `hostIPC`, and `hostNetwork`) which make use of these host namespaces are set to `false`.|5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4||
|disallow-image-tags|Validate|Pod|Best Practices|Mutable tags, like 'latest', can lead to unexpected errors if the image changes. A best practice is to use an immutable tag that maps to a specific version of an application Pod.|Validates that the image tag is defined and is not in the disallowed list|||
|disallow-istio-injection-bypass|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|The Istio service mesh uses a sidecar to encrypt traffic.  Unless an application is managing its own encrypted traffic, Istio should be used.|Validates that pods do not have the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` label set to `false`.|||
|disallow-labels|Validate|Pod|Best Practices|Some labels control functionality driven by other cluster-wide tools and are not normally set by some class of users.|Prevents the use of labels contained in the specified list.||Ensures users either don't set reserved labels or use a newer version of labels.|
|disallow-namespaces|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|Kubernetes Namespaces are an optional feature that provide a way to segment and isolate cluster resources across multiple applications and users. As a best practice, workloads should be isolated with Namespaces. Namespaces should be required and the default (empty) Namespace should not be used.|Validates that Pods specify a namespace that is not in the disallow list.|5.7.1, 5.7.4||
|disallow-nodeport-services|Validate|Service|Best Practices (Security)|A Kubernetes Service of type NodePort uses a host port to receive traffic from any source.  A NetworkPolicy cannot be used to control traffic to host ports.  Although NodePort Services can be useful, their use must be limited to Services with additional upstream security checks.|Validates that any new Services do not use the `NodePort` type.|||
|disallow-pod-exec|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|The `exec` and `attach` command may be used to gain shell access, or run other commands, in a container. While this can be useful for troubleshooting purposes, it could represent an attack vector and is discouraged.|Only allows Pod exec and attach commands to Pods in the specified list of namespaces.|||
|disallow-privilege-escalation|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Restricted)|Privilege escalation, such as via set-user-ID or set-group-ID file mode, should not be allowed.|Ensures `allowPrivilegeEscalation` is either undefined or set to `false`.|5.2.5||
|disallow-privileged-containers|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|Privileged mode disables most security mechanisms and must not be allowed.|Ensures Pods do not call for privileged mode (`privileged` must be undefined or `false`).|5.2.1||
|disallow-rbac-on-default-serviceaccounts|Validate|RoleBinding; ClusterRoleBinding|Best Practices (Security)|By default, pods are run using the automatically created `default` ServiceAccount in the pod's namespace.  The default service account has no permissions other than those of an unauthenticated user.  To enforce the least privilege best practice, additional permissions should not be allowed on the default service account.|Blocks role binding to default service accounts.|5.1.5||
|disallow-selinux-options|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|SELinux options can be used to escalate privileges.|Ensures that the `seLinuxOptions` used are not in the disallowed list.||Should be paired with `restrict-selinux-type`|
|disallow-shared-subpath-volume-writes|Validate|Pod|Vulnerability|A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a user may be able to create a container with subpath volume mounts to access files and directories outside of the volume, including on the host filesystem.| Disallows containers that use volume mounts with subpaths.||CVE-2021-25741|
|disallow-tolerations|Validate|Pod; RuntimeClass|Best Practices (Security)|Taints and tolerations provide one mechanism to allow fine-grained control of the placement of pods on a specific set of nodes.  To permit the Kubernetes scheduler to place a pod on a node with a taint, you can add a toleration to the pod's specification.  If a taint is used to restrict a node to critical pods only, tolerations that match the taint should not be allowed in unauthorized pods.|Block pods with tolerations, including global, that match the specified list of taints|||
|require-annotations|Validate|Pod|Best Practices|Some annotations control functionality that is needed for cluster-wide tools to function.|Requires the use of annotations and values contained in the specified list.|||
|require-cpu-limit|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|As application workloads share cluster resources, it is important to limit CPU resources in containers to prevent resource exhaustion and denial-of-service.|Validates that all containers have CPU limits defined and the value is in the specified range.|||
|require-drop-all-capabilities|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Restricted)|Capabilities permit privileged actions without giving full root access. All capabilities should be dropped from a Pod, with only those required added back.|Ensures that all containers explicitly specify `drop: ["ALL"]`.|5.2.7, 5.2.9|Use with `restrict-capabilities`|
|require-image-signature|VerifyImage|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|Using the Cosign project, OCI images may be signed to ensure supply chain security is maintained. Those signatures can be verified before pulling into a cluster.|Checks the signature to ensure it has been signed by verifying its signature against the public key.|||
|require-istio-on-namespaces|Validate|Namespace|Best Practices (Security)|The Istio service mesh uses a sidecar to encrypt traffic.  Unless an application is managing its own encrypted traffic, Istio should be used.|Validates that the `istio-injection` label is set to `enabled` on namespace resources.|||
|require-labels|Validate|Pod|Best Practices|A common set of labels on resources allows tools to work interoperably, describing objects in a common manner that all tools can understand and query.|Validates that the labels and values specified in the required list are present.|||
|require-memory-limit|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|As application workloads share cluster resources, it is important to limit memory resources in containers to prevent resource exhaustion and denial-of-service.|Validates that all containers have memory limits defined and the value is within the specified range.|||
|require-non-root-group|Pod|Validate|Pod Security Standards (Restricted)|Following the least privilege principle, access to the root group ID should be forbidden in containers|Ensures containers are running with groups (`runAsGroup`, `fsGroup`, and `supplementalGroups`) > 0.|||
|require-non-root-user|Pod|Validate|Pod Security Standards (Restricted)|Following the least privilege principle, containers should not be run as root|Ensures containers have `runAsNonRoot` set to `true` and `runAsUser` > 0.|5.2.6||
|require-probes|Validate|Pod|Best Practices|Liveness and readiness probes need to be configured to correctly manage a Pod's lifecycle during deployments, restarts, and upgrades. For each Pod, a periodic `livenessProbe` is performed by the kubelet to determine if the Pod's containers are running or need to be restarted. A `readinessProbe` is used by Services and Deployments to determine if the Pod is ready to receive network traffic.|Validates that all containers have liveness and readiness probes by ensuring the `periodSeconds` field is greater than zero.|||
|require-requests-equal-limits|Validate|Pod|Best Practices|Pods which have limits equal to requests are given a Guaranteed quality of service class which is the highest schedulable class. The Kubernetes scheduler assigns Guaranteed pods only to nodes which have enough resources to fulfil their CPU and memory requests.  In addition, Guaranteed pods are the last to be evicted when a node is running low on resources.|Checks that all containers have memory requests equal to limits to get a Guaranteed QoS class.|| Should only be assigned to critical resources.|
|require-ro-rootfs|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|A read-only root file system helps to enforce an immutable infrastructure strategy.  Containers should only need to write to mounted volumes that persist state or cache data.  An immutable root filesystem can also prevent malicious binaries from writing to the host system.|Validates that containers define a `securityContext` with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`.|||
|restrict-apparmor|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|AppArmor is used as an access control framework.  AppArmor uses the `runtime/default` profile by default.|Ensures Pods do not override the AppArmor profile with values outside of the specified list||Applies to Debian Linux distros only.|
|restrict-capabilities|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Restricted)|Capabilities permit privileged actions without giving full root access.  Adding capabilities beyond the default set must not be allowed.|Ensures users cannot add additional capabilities beyond the specified list to a Pod.|5.2.7, 5.2.8, 5.2.9|Use with `require-drop-all-capabilities`|
|restrict-external-ips|Validate|Service|Vulnerability|Service externalIPs can be used for a MITM attack.|Restricts externalIPs to a specified list.||CVE-2020-8554|
|restrict-external-names|Validate|Service|Vulnerability|Service external names can be used for a MITM attack.  External names can be used by an attacker to point back to localhost or internal IP addresses for exploitation.|Restricts services using external names to a specified list.||CVE-2020-8554|
|restrict-group-id|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|Processes inside a pod can be given group permissions by setting `runAsGroup` or `supplementalGroups`.  Volume mounts can be mounted as a specific group using `fsGroup`.  Group IDs below 1000 are generally reserved for system accounts, services, and special accounts.|Restricts group IDs to the specified list of values||Use with `require-non-root-group` to validate `runAsGroup` is defined.|
|restrict-host-path-mount|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|`hostPath` volumes consume the underlying node's file system. If `hostPath` volumes are not universally disabled, they should be restricted to specific host paths to prevent access to sensitive information.|Ensures that `hostPath` volume paths are in the specified list.||Strongly recommended to pair this with another to require `readOnly` on `hostPath` volumes.|
|restrict-host-path-mount-pv|Validate|PersistentVolume|Best Practices (Security)|PV using hostPath consume the underlying node's file system. If not universally disabled,they should be restricted to specific host paths to prevent access to sensitive information.|Ensures that PV `hostPath` volume paths are in the specified list.||Strongly recommended to pair this with another to require `readOnly` on `hostPath` volumes.|
|restrict-host-path-write|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|`hostPath` volumes consume the underlying node's file system. If `hostPath` volumes are not universally disabled, they should be required to be read-only.  Pods which are allowed to mount `hostPath` volumes in read/write mode pose a security risk even if confined to a "safe" file system on the host and may escape those confines.|Checks containers for `hostPath` volumes and validates they are explicitly mounted in `readOnly` mode.||Strongly recommended to pair this with another to restrict the path of `hostPath` volumes to a known list.|
|restrict-host-ports|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|Access to host ports allows potential snooping of network traffic and should not be allowed, or at minimum restricted to a known list.|Ensures only approved ports are defined in container's `hostPort` field|||
|restrict-image-registries|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|Images from unknown, public registries can be of dubious quality and may not be scanned and secured, representing a high degree of risk. Requiring use of known, approved registries helps reduce threat exposure by ensuring image pulls only come from them.|Validates that all images originate from a registry in the approved list|||
|restrict-proc-mount|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|The default `/proc` masks are set up to reduce the attack surface and should be required.|Ensures nothing but the specified `procMount` values can be used.|||
|restrict-seccomp|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|The SecComp profile should not be explicitly set to `Unconfined`.|Ensures that the `seccompProfile.Type` is undefined or restricted to the values in the specified list.|5.7.2||
|restrict-selinux-type|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|SELinux options can be used to escalate privileges.|Ensures that the `seLinuxOptions` type field is undefined or restricted to the specified list.||Should be paired with `disallow-selinux-options`.|
|restrict-sysctls|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Baseline)|Sysctl can disable security mechanisms or affect all containers on a host, and should be restricted to a specified "safe" subset. A sysctl is considered safe if it is namespaced and is isolated from other Pods and processes on the same Node.|Ensures that all `sysctls` used are in the specified list.|||
|restrict-user-id|Validate|Pod|Best Practices (Security)|Processes inside a pod can be made to run with a specific user ID by setting `runAsUser`.  User IDs below 1000 are generally reserved for system accounts, services, and special accounts.|Restricts user IDs to the specified list of values.|||
|restrict-volume-types|Validate|Pod|Pod Security Standards (Restricted)|Volume types, beyond the core set, should be restricted to limit exposure to potential vulnerabilities in Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers.  In addition, HostPath volumes should not be allowed because host directories could be exploited to access shared data or escalate privileges.|Restricts use of volume types to the specified list.|||
|update-image-pull-policy|mutate|Pod|Helper|If mutable tags (e.g. latest) are used for images, it may be desirable to to have the `imagePullPolicy` set to `Always` to ensure that future pulls will get the latest image.|Adds or modifies the `imagePullPolicy` to set it to the desired value on all tagged images.||Images using digests are ignored.|
|update-image-registry|Mutate|Pod|Helper|It is common practice to pull images from a local proxy or approved registry.|Will mutate existing image registries so pulls are directed to desired registries.|||
|update-token-automount|Mutate|ServiceAccount|Best Practices (Security)|Kubernetes automatically mounts API credentials in each Pod using the service account.  Under the least privilege best practice, the default service account should not have access to the Kuberenetes API.  This helps to prevent exploitation of API vulnerabilities.|Adds configuration to pods so that the service account token is not automatically mounted. (`automountServiceAccountToken: false`)|5.1.6||

## Default settings

The following criteria were used to determine if a policy should be enabled, and if enabled, should be enforcing.

1. All vulnerability policies will be enabled and enforcing
1. All Pod Security Standard policies will be enabled and enforcing
1. Validation policies for security or cluster stability (e.g. deprecated APIs) best practices will be enabled and auditing.
1. Other best practice policies will be disabled.
1. Helper policies will be disabled.

> These are the default settings for this Helm chart.  This list is not a recommendation on how to set the policies.  Each policy should be evaluated and used appropriately if it has value.
