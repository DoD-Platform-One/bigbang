# Development Environment overview

[[_TOC_]]

BigBang developers use [k3d](https://k3d.io/), a lightweight wrapper to run [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. K3d is a virtualized kubernetes cluster that is quick to start and tear down for fast development iteration. K3d is sufficient for 90% of BigBang development work. In limited cases developers will use real infrastructure k8s deployments with Rancher, Konvoy, etc. Only k3d is covered here in this document. The others are out of scope.

It is not recommend to run k3d with BigBang on your local computer. Instead use a remote k3d cluster running on an EC2 instance to shift the compute and network load to the cloud. BigBang can be quite resource-intensive and it requires a huge download bandwidth for the images. If you do insist on running k3d locally you should disable certain packages before deploying. You can do this in the values.yaml file by setting the package deploy to false. One of the packages that is most resource-intensive is the logging package. And you should create a local image registry cache to minimize the amount of image downloading.

There is a script in the [/docs/developer/scripts/](./scripts/) directory that automates the creation and teardown of a development environment. There is a video tutorial in the PlatformOne IL2 Confluence. Search for "T3" and click the link to the page. The video is #57 on 22-February-2022.

The manual steps included below are no longer maintained. The manual steps are only included for historical reference as a study guide to understand how the script works. The script is the singular focus for development environments.

## Prerequisites

### Required Access

- AWS GovCloud "coder" account - talk to your team lead for access
- [BigBang repository](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/bigbang)
- [Iron Bank registry](https://registry1.dso.mil/)

### Local Utilities

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## DEPRECATED AND UNMAINTAINED: Manual Creation of a Development Environment

This section will cover the creation of an environment manually. This is a good place to start because it creates an understanding of everything that the automated method does for you and uses far less cloud resources.

### Step 1

Create an Ubuntu EC2 instance using the AWS console with the following attributes. Please clean up after yourself. Stop or delete any instances that you are not currently using. See addendum for using Amazon Linux2 instead of Ubuntu. See addendum for using aws command line.

- Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type
- t2.2xlarge
- IAM Role: InstanceOpsRole (This will add support for sops encryption with KMS)
- User Data (as Text):

```shell
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="==MYBOUNDARY=="

--==MYBOUNDARY==
Content-Type: text/x-shellscript; charset="us-ascii"

#!/bin/bash
# Set the vm.max_map_count to 262144.
# Required for Elastic to run correctly without OOM errors.
echo 'vm.max_map_count=524288' > /etc/sysctl.d/vm-max_map_count.conf
echo 'fs.file-max=131072' > /etc/sysctl.d/fs-file-max.conf
sysctl -p
ulimit -n 131072
ulimit -u 8192
modprobe xt_REDIRECT
modprobe xt_owner
modprobe xt_statistic
```

- 50 Gigs of disk space
- Tags:  ```Name: <firstname.lastname>```
- Security Group: All TCP limited to your local IP address. If you already have a security group, select it.  Otherwise create a new one. See addendum for more secure way with only port 22 for ssh traffic using sshuttle.
- If you have created an existing key pair that you still have access to, select it. If not, create a new key pair. Be sure to save the pem file.

### Step 2

Configure the EC2 instance. SSH into your new EC2 instance and configure it with the following:

- SSH: Find your instance's public IP. This may be in the output of your `run-instance` command, if not search for your instance id in the AWS web console and under the details copy your public ipv4 address. Example below assumes this value is `1.2.3.4`, replace that with the actual value.

```shell
EC2_PUBLIC_IP=1.2.3.4
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-ec2.pem ubuntu@$EC2_PUBLIC_IP
```

- Install Docker CE

```shell
# Remove any old Docker items
sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

# Install all prerequisites for Docker
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common

# Add the Docker repository, we are installing from Docker and not the Ubuntu APT repo.
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

# Install Docker
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Add your base user to the Docker group so that you do not need sudo to run docker commands
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# It is important to log out and back in to have the user group changes take effect.
logout
```

- Install K3D on the EC2 instance

```shell
# Note: The current version of K3D uses a broken version of K3s. The 2020-08 workaround is to install K3D 4.4.7
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | TAG=v4.4.7 bash
# check version
k3d version
```

- Start our dev cluster on the EC2 instance using K3D. See addendum for more secure way with only port 22 exposed using private ip and sshuttle & section to have support for multi istio ingressgateways with a K3D cluster using MetalLB.

```shell
EC2_PUBLIC_IP=$( curl https://ipinfo.io/ip )
echo $EC2_PUBLIC_IP

# Create k3d cluster
k3d cluster create \
    --servers 1 \
    --agents 3 \
    --volume /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=traefik" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=metrics-server" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--tls-san=$EC2_PUBLIC_IP" \
    --port 80:80@loadbalancer \
    --port 443:443@loadbalancer \
    --api-port 6443
```

### Step 3

Test the cluster from your local workstation. Copy the contents of the k3d kubeconfig from the EC2 instance to your local workstation. Do it manually with copy and paste.

```shell
# on the EC2 instance
echo $EC2_PUBLIC_IP
cat ~/.kube/config
```

Or, use secure copy to move it to your workstation. example:

```shell
scp -i ~/.ssh/your-ec2.pem ubuntu@$EC2_PUBLIC_IP:~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config
```

Edit the kubeconfig on your workstation. Replace the server host ```0.0.0.0``` with with the public IP of the EC2 instance. Test cluster access from your local workstation.

```shell
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

### Step 4

Start deploying to your k3d cluster. The scope of this documentation is limited to creating your dev environment. How to deploy BigBang is intentionally NOT included here. Those steps are left to other documents. You will need to install flux in your cluster before deploying BigBang.

```shell
# git clone the bigbang repo somewhere on your workstation
git clone https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/bigbang.git
# run the script to install flux in your cluster using your registry1.dso.mil image pull credentials
cd ./bigbang
./scripts/install_flux.sh -u your-user-name -p your-pull-secret
```

**Note1:** When deploying to k3d, the load balancer must be added to `excludedResources` under several violations for gatekeeper. This can be done by modifying `chart/values.yaml` file or passing an override file (e.g. `docs/example_configs/opa-overrides-k3d.yaml`) with the values set below.  This is for development purposes only.

```yaml
gatekeeper:
  values:
    violations:
      allowedCapabilities:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer containers to not drop capabilities
          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
      allowedDockerRegistries:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:

      allowedSecCompProfiles:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:

          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
      allowedUsers:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer containers to run as any user/group
          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
      containerRatio:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer containers to have undefined limits/requests
          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
      hostNetworking:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer containers to mount host ports
          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
      noBigContainers:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer containers to have undefined limits/requests
          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
      noPrivilegedEscalation:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer containers to have undefined security context
          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
      readOnlyRoot:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer containers to mount filesystems read/write
          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
      requiredLabels:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer pods to not have required labels
          - istio-system/svclb-.*
      requiredProbes:
        parameters:
          excludedResources:
          # Allows k3d load balancer containers to not have readiness/liveness probes
          - istio-system/lb-port-.*
```

**Note2:** The information in this note is simply to give you awareness in advance. You should create local directory on your workstation where you store your helm values override files. Development changes made in the code for testing could accidentally be committed. That is why you should create a separate local directory to hold your override values for testing. The location can be anywhere on your workstation but it is most convenient to place them in a sibling directory next to the BigBang repos. Below is an example directory structure. The directory names are fake (for example only). Other documents will give more specific detail as needed.

  ```plaintext
  â”œâ”€â”€ BigBangCodeRepo/
  â””â”€â”€ overrides/
      â”œâ”€â”€ override-values-1.yaml
      â”œâ”€â”€ override-values-2.yaml
      â””â”€â”€ override-values-3.yaml
  ```

## Addendum

### More secure method with `sshuttle`

Instead of opening all TCP traffic (all ports) to your local public ip address you only need port 22 for ssh traffic. And then use sshuttle to tunnel into your EC2 instance. Here is an example assuming that your EC2 is in the default VPC. All other steps being the same as above.

```shell
# ssh to your EC2 instance using the public IP. For Amazon Linux 2 the user is "ec2-user"
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-ec2.pem ubuntu@$EC2_PUBLIC_IP

# set environment variable for private IP
EC2_PRIVATE_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')

# create the k3d cluster with SAN for private IP
# Create k3d cluster
k3d cluster create \
    --servers 1 \
    --agents 3 \
    --volume ~/.k3d/p1-registries.yaml:/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml \
    --volume /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=traefik" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=metrics-server" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--tls-san=$EC2_PRIVATE_IP" \
    --port 80:80@loadbalancer \
    --port 443:443@loadbalancer \
    --api-port 6443
```

Then on your workstation edit the kubeconfig with the EC2 private ip. In a separate terminal window start a tunnel session with sshuttle using the EC2 public IP.

```shell
sshuttle --dns -vr ec2-user@$EC2_PUBLIC_IP 172.31.0.0/16 --ssh-cmd 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-ec2.pem'
```

#### A note on DNS forwarding

Mac antivirus tools have been known to interfere with DNS forwarding. In other cases, due to the cluster configuration, the hostnames do resolve, but to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) or to other 127.0.0.0/8 addresses

If the hosts shown in the HOSTS column from `kubectl get vs -A` don't resolve to the host(s) running the cluster (or don't resolve at all), add them to your /etc/hosts file:

```shell
<IP of the EC2 instance> kibana.bigbang.dev prometheus.bigbang.dev grafana.bigbang.dev alertmanager.bigbang.dev kiali.bigbang.dev tracing.bigbang.dev
```

It is important to use hostnames when accessing cluster apps in a browser instead of IPs as the hostname sent by the browser in its HTTP GET request is used by the load balancers (see: kubectl get svc -n istio-system) to direct the traffic to the correct app.

### Multi Ingress-gateway Support with MetalLB and K3D

1. If you want to utilize BigBang's multi ingress-gateway support for istio, it is possible with K3D but requires some different flags at cluster creation.

```shell
# ssh to your EC2 instance using the public IP. For Amazon Linux 2 the user is "ec2-user"
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-ec2.pem ubuntu@$EC2_PUBLIC_IP

# set environment variable for private IP
EC2_PRIVATE_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')

# create the k3d cluster with SAN for private IP
# Create k3d cluster
k3d cluster create \
    --servers 1 \
    --agents 3 \
    --volume ~/.k3d/p1-registries.yaml:/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml \
    --volume /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=traefik" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=metrics-server" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=servicelb" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--tls-san=$EC2_PRIVATE_IP" \
    --port 80:80@loadbalancer \
    --port 443:443@loadbalancer \
    --api-port 6443
```

- This will create a K3D cluster just like before, except we need to ensure the built in "servicelb" add-on is disabled so we can use metallb.

1. Find the Subnet for your k3d cluster's Docker network

    ```shell
    docker network inspect k3d-k3s-default | jq .[0].IPAM.Config[0]
    ```

    - k3d-k3s-default is the name of the default bridge network k3d creates when creating a k3d cluster.
    - We need the "Subnet": value to populate the correct addresses in the ConfigMap below.
    - If my output looks like:

    ```json
    {
      "Subnet": "172.18.0.0/16",
      "Gateway": "172.18.0.1"
    }
    ```

    - Then the addresses I want to input for metallb would be `172.18.1.240-172.18.1.243` so that I can reserve 4 IP addresses within the subnet of the Docker Network.

1. Before installing BigBang we will need to install and configure [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/concepts/)

    ```shell
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.10.2/manifests/namespace.yaml
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.10.2/manifests/metallb.yaml
    cat << EOF > metallb-config.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      namespace: metallb-system
      name: config
    data:
      config: |
        address-pools:
        - name: default
          protocol: layer2
          addresses:
          - 172.18.1.240-172.18.1.243
    EOF
    kubectl create -f metallb-config.yaml
    ```

    - The commands will create a metallb install and configure it to assign LoadBalancer IPs within the range `172.18.1.240-172.18.1.243` which is within the standard Docker Bridge Network CIDR meaning that the linux network stack will have a route to this network already.

1. Deploy BigBang with istio ingress gateways configured.

1. Verify LoadBalancers

    ```shell
    kubectl get svc -n istio-system
    ```

    - You should see a result like:

    ```console
    NAME                         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                                                      AGE
    istiod                       ClusterIP      10.43.59.25    <none>         15010/TCP,15012/TCP,443/TCP,15014/TCP                        151m
    private-ingressgateway       LoadBalancer   10.43.221.12   172.18.1.240   15021:31000/TCP,80:31001/TCP,443:31002/TCP,15443:31003/TCP   150m
    public-ingressgateway        LoadBalancer   10.43.35.202   172.18.1.241   15021:30000/TCP,80:30001/TCP,443:30002/TCP,15443:30003/TCP   150m
    passthrough-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.43.173.31   172.18.1.242   15021:32000/TCP,80:32001/TCP,443:32002/TCP,15443:32003/TCP   119m
    ```

    - With the key information here being the assigned `EXTERNAL-IP` sections for the ingressgateways.

1. Update Hosts file on ec2 instance with IPs above

    ```shell
    sudo vim /etc/hosts
    ```

    - Update it with similar entries:
      - Applications with the following values (eg for Jaeger):

        ```yaml
        jaeger:
          ingress:
            gateway: "" #(Defaults to public-ingressgateway)
        ```

        We will need to set to the EXTERNAL-IP of the public-ingressgateway

        ```plaintext
        172.18.1.241 jaeger.bigbang.dev
        ```

      - Applications with the following values (eg for Logging):

        ```yaml
        logging:
          ingress:
            gateway: "private"
        ```

        We will need to set to the EXTERNAL-IP of the private-ingressgateway

        ```plaintext
        172.18.1.240 kibana.bigbang.dev
        ```

      - Keycloak will need to be set to the External-IP of the passthrough-ingressgateway

        ```plaintext
        172.18.1.242 keycloak.bigbang.dev
        ```

    - With these DNS settings in place you will now be able to reach the external *.bigbang.dev URLs from this EC2 instance.

    - To reach outside the EC2 instance use either SSH or SSHUTTLE commands to specify a local port for Dynamic application-level port forwarding (ssh -D). Example

        ```shell
        sshuttle --dns -vr ubuntu@$EC2_PRIVATE_IP 172.31.0.0/16 --ssh-cmd 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/your.pem -D 127.0.0.1:12345'
        ```

    - and utilize Firefox's built in SOCKS proxy configuration to route DNS and web traffic through the application-level port forward from the SSH command.
          1. Open Firefox browser
          1. Click on hamburger menu in upper right corner and select ```Settings```
          1. At the bottom of ```Settings``` page in the ```Network Settings``` section select ```Settings```
          1. Select ```Manual proxy configuration``` and the following values

        ```plaintext
        SOCKS Host:  localhost
        Port:  12345
        ```

        and select SOCKS v5
          1. Select ```Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5```

1. To be able to test SSO between BigBang Package apps and your own Keycloak instance deployed in the same cluster you will need to take some extra steps. For SSO OIDC to work the app pod from within the cluster must be able to reach ```keycloak.bigbang.dev```. When using a development k3d environment with the development TLS cert the public DNS for ```keycloak.bigbang.dev``` points to localhost IP 127.0.0.1. This means that from within pod containers your Keycloak deployment can't be found. Therefore the SSO will fail. The development hack to fix this is situation is to edit the cluster coredns configmap and add a NodeHosts entry for Keycloak.
    - Edit the coredns configmap

      ```shell
      kubectl edit configmap/coredns -n kube-system
      ```

    - add NodeHosts entry for Keycloak using using the passthrough-ingressgateway service EXTERNAL-IP

      ```yaml
      data:
        NodeHosts: |
          172.18.0.2 k3d-k3s-default-server-0
          172.18.0.3 k3d-k3s-default-agent-0
          172.18.0.4 k3d-k3s-default-agent-1
          172.18.0.5 k3d-k3s-default-agent-2
          172.18.1.242 keycloak.bigbang.dev
      ```

    - Restart the coredns pod so it can pick up the new config

      ```console
      kubectl rollout restart deployment coredns -n kube-system
      ```

    - You might also need to restart the Package app pods before they can detect the new coredns config
    - Deploy Keycloak using the example dev config values ```docs/developer/example_configs/keycloak-dev-values.yaml```

### Amazon Linux 2

Here are the configuration steps if you want to use a Fedora based instance. All other steps are similar to Ubuntu.

```shell
# update system
sudo yum update -y

# install and start docker
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl start docker.service

# fix docker config for ulimit nofile.
# this is a bug in the AMI that will eventually be fixed
sudo sed -i 's/^OPTIONS=.*/OPTIONS=\"--default-ulimit nofile=65535:65535\"/' /etc/sysconfig/docker
sudo systemctl restart docker.service

# install k3d
sudo wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

# exit ssh and then reconnect so you can use docker as non-root
```

### Setting an imagePullSecret on the cluster with k3d

**_This methodology is not recommended_**
It is possible to set your image pull secret on the cluster so that you don't have to put your credentials in the code or in the command line in later steps

```shell
# Create the directory for the k3s registry config.
mkdir ~/.k3d/

# Define variables
YOURUSERNAME="<user_name>"
YOURCLISECRET="<CLI secret>"
EC2_PUBLIC_IP=$( curl https://ipinfo.io/ip )

# Create the config file using your registry1 credentials.
cat << EOF > ~/.k3d/p1-registries.yaml
configs:
  "registry1.dso.mil":
    auth:
      username: $YOURUSERNAME
      password: $YOURCLISECRET
EOF

# Create k3d cluster
k3d cluster create \
    --servers 1 \
    --agents 3 \
    --volume ~/.k3d/p1-registries.yaml:/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml \
    --volume /etc/machine-id:/etc/machine-id \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=traefik" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--disable=metrics-server" \
    --k3s-server-arg "--tls-san=$EC2_PUBLIC_IP" \
    --port 80:80@loadbalancer \
    --port 443:443@loadbalancer \
    --api-port 6443
```

Here is an explanation of what we are doing with this command:

- `--servers 1` Creating 1 master/server
- `--agents 3` Creating 3 agent nodes
