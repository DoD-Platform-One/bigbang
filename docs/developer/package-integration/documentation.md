# Documentation

Big Bang requires some additional documentation for supported packages to help user's understand how it interacts with other components.  The following are documents that should be created or updated for integration into Big Bang:

- Package Architecture: See [Big Bang's Architecture instructions](../../understanding-bigbang/package-architecture/ref-package.md). Examples are included in [understanding-bigbang/package-architecture](../../understanding-bigbang/package-architecture).
- [Big Bang Packages](../../packages.md)
- [Default Credentials](../../guides/using-bigbang/default-credentials.md)
- [Licensing](../../understanding-bigbang/licensing-model.md)
- [Minimum Hardware Requirements](../../prerequisites/minimum-hardware-requirements.md)
