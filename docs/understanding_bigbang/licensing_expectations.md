# BigBang Licensing Expectations

While BigBang is open source and free to use, the same cannot be said of its components. The licensing requirements of components requires a nuanced explanation. The intent of this document is to be a self service resource to help consumers of BigBang make an informed decision regarding licenses they may need to successfully deploy an ATO'able DevSecOps Platform using BigBang.

## What Licenses Do I Need for Bigbang?

There are two issues that make it difficult to figure out BigBang's license requirements:

1. The modular (and in some cases swappable) componentized nature of BigBang means choices affect license requirements. OS, Kubernetes Distribution, and Application decisions need to be made before license requirements can be sorted out.
1. Freemium applications often require a license to unlock features like HA (High Availability), advanced SSO functionality with authn, authz, and audit logging of federated users, or advanced compliance controls like FIPS 140-2 mode, compliance reporting, or audit logs.

## What Components Could Have Licenses?

1. OS / CSP(Cloud Service Providers) VM Images
   * RHEL requires a subscription and comes with vendor support
   * CSPs often offer licensed VM Images at additional per hour cost, these add features like offloading STIG/CIS OS hardening
   * Several free Linux OS Distributions exist, including Ubuntu and free RHEL alternatives like Amazon Linux 2 and others. There are also tools like [openscap](https://www.open-scap.org/), which has ansible and bash scripts to automate STIG/CIS benchmark compliance for OS security to help automate DIY hardening of the OS.
1. Kubernetes Distributions
   * RedHat OpenShift, VMware TKG, and D2IQ Konvoy each require a license, that comes with support and additional features, they each offer 30-90 day trial licenses
   * There are free options like kubeadm, k0s, k3s, RKE2, talos-systems, and many other CNCF compliant distributions.
   * k0s, RKE2, and talos-systems are free options with optional paid Vendor Support.
1. BigBang's Core Applications:
   * Many of the core applications are free open source software
   * Twistlock is a core component that requires a license
   * ElasticSearch is a core component that requires a license to unlock additional features, that could be considered required in some cases (more on this nuance below.)
   * Although BigBang is free, support can be purchased.
1. BigBang's AddOn Applications:
   * Also include a mix of free, freemium, and licensed products.

## Who Purchases the Licenses?

Licensing of products deployable by BigBang are not covered by the BigBang team. As a general rule of thumb the acquisition of licenses is the responsibility of the end-user's  organization, and product vendors should be contacted for support of their respective products. (PartyBus is an example of an exception to the rule of thumb.)

## Who Decides If a Licenced Feature in a Freemium Application Is a Hard Requirement?

* The Consumer of BigBang, their security team, and their AO (Authorizing official) need to decide if licensed features constitute a hard requirement or if free tier functionality can be considered at lower impact levels or unique use cases.
* In most cases licenses will be required due to Security Controls only being available in the fully licensed version; however, users may be able to hold off on licensed versions for non-ATO'd proof of concept deployments or risk acceptance by an AO for unique scenarios.
* Even if there isn't a hard requirement for a license (like in the case of a Kubernetes Cluster), consumers of BigBang may still want to consider purchasing licenses or support contracts.

PartyBus's Gitlab pipelines integrate with additional licensed apps: Twistlock, Anchore, [Fortify](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/third-party/fortify), [SD Elements](https://www.securitycompass.com/sdelements/), and others. (This is offered as a data point, it doesn't mean these are required for a cATO pipeline, the Consumer of BigBang's AO makes that call.)  <https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/#self-managed>  <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/tree/master#editions> |
