# Troubleshooting Upgrades
Usually, a good place to start with troubleshooting is to identify which package had issues upgrading. After identifying the package that had problems it can be helpful to re-review the release notes and changelog for that specific package to see if any changes were missed that may have caused the upgrade issue you ran into.

Specific troubleshooting steps for common issues will be added here in the future.
