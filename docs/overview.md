# Confluence

Confluence is a collaborative document and workflow tool.  This is a licensed poduct and will require a license code the first time you access the product.  Additional docs for using confluence can be found at <https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/features>.

This repository provides a Helm chart for deploying Confluence using Iron Bank images.  It is also used by Big Bang to deploy Confluence as a 3rd party package.
