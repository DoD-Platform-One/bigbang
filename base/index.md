Welcome to the assembled documentation for Big Bang!

This documentation is generated from the `docs` and `charter` folders in [Big Bang](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/bigbang), and each of the `docs` folders in [Big Bang Packages](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps).

Ready to rock and roll? [Start with the `Getting Started`](./getting-started)
